<p>This is the very first website I ever created in my one credit class, introduction to web design and development. In this class I created a website for a fictional clothing company which I called Aesthete Apparel using HTML, Bootstrap for responsiveness and positioning, and my own CSS for other styling. The top things I learned when creating this website was HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>This is another website created for a class. In this class I came up with a website concept, a site plan, and a style guide (This can be found in the footer of the website). I created the website using semantically correct HTML, CSS, and a little PHP for modularization. I implemented CSS media queries for responsiveness as well as some techniques to improve the overall SEO of my website. The top things I learned were how to create a site plan and style guide for a website that has at least 10 pages, how to use media queries, how to use an FTP client and host, and how to improve a sites search engine optimization.</p>

<p>This website was the final for my front-end development class. I was asked to create a website for a (fictional) triathlon. I was given certain details but I had to come up with other details and media on my own. I was given one week to start and finish this website. I created a site plan and style guide based on the information I was given. I then built the website using semantically correct HTML and CSS. </p>

<p>This website was created for my web business class. In this class I created a business and a website in order to run the business online. I created the website on word press. For this class I needed to optimize it for search engines and create a way for customers to make payments online. Although this business never actually ran, the framework is in place. The top things I learned were how to use word press, how to take payments on a website using PayPal, and how to improve search engine optimization.</p>

  <p>This website was created on my own accord to serve as my professional portfolio. This website was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP. The vector images (as seen above) were created using Adobe Illustrator. Usually when I write my HTML and CSS I use brackets, but for this site I have chosen to learn how to use Adobe Dreamweaver. I also use netbeans when writing PHP and I test it using a local host.</p>

  <p>This is a promotional flier for a graduate leadership conference created in my visual media class.&nbsp;I started out by looking at the requirements of the projects and trying to understand the message and the audience. Once I understood whom I was targeting and what I wanted to portray I made a few sketches. Upon picking my favorite layout I put it together in InDesign. I tried to make an effective and professional design. I printed my design out and showed it to a friend in the class and my teacher. We were able to find some good things in the design and identify some weak points. Based on what we talked about I was able to make my design better and more effective. One thing I worked on after talking to others about my draft was the flow. Before my design trapped the viewer's eye at the top, now the viewer's eye goes down the page to read the information. The top things I learned were implementing design principles and using Adobe InDesign.</p>

  <p>A color full-bleed event ad to promote a fundraiser using only Microsoft Word and a scanner, created for my Visual Media class.&nbsp;First, I did some brainstorming and sketching. I thought of different events I could have and all the details that would be associated with that event. Once i picked one I did a couple sketches and got to work. After sketching I picked font categories and gave myself three color scheme options to play with. I scanned my photo and deleted the background using a tool in Microsoft word. Afterwords I added text boxes and put the information I needed on the poster. Once all of the information was in I formatted it. I picked my fonts and made the text different sizes to suit its function and I made sure everything was aligned the way I wanted it to be. The last thing I did was play with color. I had a few options for color schemes and I picked the one that worked the best. The top things I learned were how to use a scaner to add an image that is not digital and how to design in Microsoft Word.</p>

  <p>For this assignment in my Visual Media class I was required to demonstrate good photography and image editing skills. Incorporating color into a poster layout with original photo. I took a photo of my longboard on a camera and took it into Photoshop and performed four basic edits: Vibrancy/saturation, levels, selective color, and sharpening. After that I picked a color scheme and added text and some shapes using Photoshop. The top things I learned were how to take photos with good lighting, composition, and focus, and how to use Adobe Photoshop.</p>

  <p>An inspirational montage made by the blending of several images, and the use of typography.&nbsp;To begin, I opened all of my photos in photoshop. Once I did that I was able to drag the photos I wanted to incorporate into my image onto the background image. I used the masking technique to blend my photos into one cohesive piece. After that I added text. I played around with size and text to make my message effective. The most important thing I learned in this assignment was how to create a mask in Adobe Photoshop in order to blend images together.</p>

  <p>This black and white composition was created for my graphic design class. To begin I did 48 small thumbnail skecthes of various shapes. After that I did 48 more sketches to refine some of my better ideas from the first round. After that I brought my top three designs into Adobe Illustrator and worked on refining them. After I had chosen the very best one I refined it so that it incorporated 6 principles of design. The top things I learned in this assignment were how to use Adobe Illustrator and create a composition incorporating 6 principles of design.</p>
