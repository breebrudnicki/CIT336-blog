    <p>I'm a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho majoring in Web Design and Development, specifically with an emphasis in Web Development and a minor in Web Design. I have experience in both frontend and backend web development as well as graphic design. I have done most of my work alone, but I also have experience working in a development team. Everything I learn ensures that I can build beautiful and responsive websites that will generate traffic. My goal as a web developer is to provide a good user experience by making the websites I develop intuitive and simple.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for an enthusiastic and proactive web designer or developer, look no further. I want to help you and I know I can.</p>
